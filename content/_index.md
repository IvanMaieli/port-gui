I am a Computer Engineering Student based in Bologna.

I build systems that cannot afford to crash. My focus is on Artificial Intelligence guidance systems, and real-time.
Currently working on the driverless race car at **Unibo Motorsport** and GNC systems at **Aurora Rocketry**. I am interested in everything that runs on bare metal and controls hardware under strict real-time constraints.

    <div class="project-desc">
        An high-performance, minimalist network sniffer engineered in C. It bypasses standard library abstractions by using Linux raw sockets (<code>AF_PACKET</code>) to provide surgical visibility into every frame crossing your network interface.
        Designed for low-latency environments and embedded systems, Coca delivers raw power with a zero-dependency footprint.

    <div class="project-desc">
        A memory allocator built to be effective fighting fragmentation. It is all written in C on linux.
        I am currently working on making it more efficient using advanced data structures. It will be thread safe in short future.

        I finetuned GPT2 locally in order to specialize it on writing haiku poetry. I deployed the project and I applied it for a contest in Bergamo, Italy (Premio "Marilli" by Sorint). I ended 3rd in Italy. I am really proud of the result, just because finetuning was pretty wild in 2023.

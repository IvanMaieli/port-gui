# **Unibo Motorsport - CPU/GPU Security**
  Currently working on CPU and GPU safety algorithm on racing cars.
  

# **Monolith Allocator**
  A memory allocator built to be effective fighting fragmentation. It is all written in C on linux.
  I am currently working on making it more efficient using advanced data structures. It will be thread safe in short future. Check it there: __https://github.com/IvanMaieli/monolith-allocator__


# **PoetrAI**
  I finetuned GPT2 locally in order to specialize it on writing haiku poetry. I deployed the project and I applied it for a contest in Bergamo, Italy (Premio "Marilli" by Sorint). I ended 3rd in Italy. I am really proud of the result, just because finetuning was pretty wild in 2023.

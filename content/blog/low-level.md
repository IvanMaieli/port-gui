title: "Why Low-Level Matters"

I am pretty sure that in the future nobody will know the meaning of the word _pointer_ [comp science field].
I can consider myself as pretty concerned: **right now code is pure garbage**. Great ideas are developed really really bad.
We have to respect our discipline, the product we sell, the experience. Our products are being used almost 5 hours per day
recently (on average), so we can't just deliver **something**. AI is just incapable of making this thing better. I think we should
make a little step back, focusing on how things work under all that abstractions that are burning the quality of softwares.
People who know low level implementations behind AIs inference are decreasing everyday; people who know how to micro-optimize sofware
performances are decreasing too; we can't afford to take this direction. Computer science is not only Web dev, frameworks and python libraries, It is optimization too, It is algos, It is data structures, It is OS syscalls, It is burning your brain just to figure out a single thing in order to create a better product. Nobody want a car that works badly most of the time, then why would someone want to use bad software?
